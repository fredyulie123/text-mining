      " Of course you can.  You just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw.   Huh?  The 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  Grove, Vance, Dean, and not a whole lot else.    As for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Greenberg, Hornsby, Cobb, etc. all played before the 40's.  Stat-wise, the 60's were  a graveyard for hitters.   How do you know?  Which ones do you consider great?   So?  Sheffield also has better shoes.  More time between pitches.  You can run the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account.   Well, can we compare them or can't we?   Why?  We can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can keep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in despair.   You haven't shown us what's *un*reasonable about the MAntle-Sheffield comparison that you yourself did.\n",

Come to the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY!  \tWe can teach you to be 'cordial' with the best of them! Use such time honored 'cordiality' techniques as:  \t1) Calling people assholes! \t2) Comparing them to viruses!  \tFor advanced students:  \t3) Comparing them to DIRTY viruses. What is a DIRTY virus, \t\tand how can you tell it from a clean one? We know, \t\tand here at the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY, \t\twe can teach you to know, too!  \tHEHEHEH.. Thanks, Roger..
