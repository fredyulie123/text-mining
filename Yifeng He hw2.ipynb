Oh no, I wasn't confused -- I understood that it was your personal opinion.  But I thought we were discussing the need to shorten games.  The arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage them from going to the ballpark.  I'd like to see if the increased length of games has negatively affected attendance.  If it has, then there *is* a problem, and something should be done about it.  If it hasn't, then there *isn't* a problem, and there's no need to monkey with things as they are.\n",

I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools, they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use computers, but I'm telling you, it's gotten to the point that I don't even edit the files anymore, just read them and throw out the trash...  And thanks to all you people that think it's wonderful to include a swear word or two in your signature files, that's really nice...  I have to read the whole article and then toss it out because of the .sig.  Don't get me wrong, I know all the words you do, (and I've even made up some of my own!) or I wouldn't be able to edit them out ;^) but this just doesn't seem to be the place, a public forum, to spew foul language, sorry..
